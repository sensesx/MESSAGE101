# MESSAGE101

Some commits are going to be made now =).

Currently working on other projects offline and this one is only for testing networking and libraries stuff.
Keep in mind that before I commited this project, I have already produced most of the code before deciding I would be sharing on github.

* Some functions and funcionality need a better implementation.
* Fixes are going to be made. Be patient.

As far as I'm concerned, no one would nor should ever use this on production. Anyway if you are wondering,
                        DON'T USE IN INSECURE ENVIROMNENTS
